  - Fish

### Installation

Simply download the files and double click on FishBotKEKW.ahk to start the script.

> To run the bot you will need AutoHotKey to be installed in your system which can be downloaded on the official [website](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

### Usage

The bot will automatically uses fish baits, and will try to equip them after every use from the first inventory slot.
***So it's important that your first inventory slot is occupied by alot of fish baits.**

Once the script is started, press F1 to select one spot, F2 for two spots or F3 for three spots where you will be fishing, then left click on the spots.

Once you selected the spots, just press F4 to start fishing.

To close the script press ESC.

### Requirements

As of now the bot only works on **1920x1080** resolutions.

Set the client to borderless window and HUD size (scaling) to 80%

Since the bot uses sound to check when fish took the bait, it is recomanded to set the Albion Online client volume at max on the windows audio mixer and **remove any other audio source**.

It is required to remove the ingame Music and Ambience sounds and set Master Volume to 17% and Scound Effects to 30%.
